# About Me
## My Interests
   -Video Games  
   * I play just about any video game: FPS, RPG, Survival-Crafting, RTS, Colony Sim, Grand Strategy, etc.  
   * You name it, and I've probably played it.

   -Animals  
   * I've always loved all types of animals. I currently have a husky mix named Luna. She's 8 months old as of January 2025, and she **_loves_** chewing on boots.
     
   -Cooking
   * Since I was a kid, I've always helped out my parents in the kitchen, and I used to bake a seemingly-endless amount of desserts during the holidays with my grandmother.

## My Background
   -I'm originally from Minnesota, and joined the Army right out of high school. I joined as a Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst, and got to do a lot of cool stuff while on the job. I ended my time on Active Duty back in March 2024, and transitioned to the North Carolina National Guard, where I've met some amazing people and got the pleasure to help the community after a hurricane hit western NC. I take pride in my military service and am always willing to talk about it.
   
   -I am currently pursuing an Associates in Cybersecurity, which I plan to transition to a Bachelor's Degree and commision as an officer in the North Carolina National Guard, hopefully as a Cyber Warfare Officer.
