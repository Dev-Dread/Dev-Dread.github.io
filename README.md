## My Background
   -I'm originally from Minnesota, and joined the Army right out of high school. I joined as a Geospatial Intelligence Imagery Analyst, and got to do a lot of cool stuff while on the job. I ended my time on Active Duty back in March 2024, and transitioned to the North Carolina National Guard, where I've met some amazing people and got the pleasure to help the community after a hurricane hit western NC. I take pride in my military service and am always willing to talk about it.  
   -I am currently pursuing an Associates in Cybersecurity, which I plan to transition to a Bachelor's Degree and commision as an officer in the North Carolina National Guard, hopefully as a Cyber Warfare Officer.
